                        Welcome to the Quick Bites School Canteen Pre-order System (the “System”). By registering,
                        accessing, or using the System, you (“User”) agree to comply with these Terms and Conditions. If
                        you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you may not use the System. Please read these
                        Terms carefully before placing any orders.
                    </v-card-text>

                        2. User Registration and Account
                    </v-card-subtitle>
                    <v-card-text>
                        To use the System, Users must register by providing accurate and complete information.
                        Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their account information,
                        including login credentials, and for all activities that occur under their account.
                        The System is available for students, staff, and teachers within the school. Unauthorized use by
                        anyone outside this group is prohibited.

                        3. Ordering Process
                    </v-card-subtitle>
                    <v-card-text>
                        By placing an order through the System, Users commit to picking up the ordered items on the same
                        day of the order.
                        Orders must be picked up before the school canteen's closing time. The canteen’s operating hours
                        will be made available to Users.
                        Failure to pick up an order by the designated closing time forfeits the User’s right to claim
                        the item the following day. No refunds will be provided for uncollected items.
                    </v-card-text>

                    <v-card-subtitle class="mt-4 text-h6" style="color: #000;">
                        4. Payment and Cancellation Policy
                    </v-card-subtitle>
                    <v-card-text>
                        Payment options may include cash, prepaid balances, or other methods made available by the
                        System.
                        If the User selects the cash payment method, the order may be canceled within 5 to 10 minutes of
                        being placed without penalty.
                        Failure to cancel an order within the specified time frame may result in the imposition of a
                        penalty fee, as outlined by the canteen’s policies, which will be communicated to Users before
                        ordering.
                        Prepaid orders are final, and no refunds will be issued once the order has been confirmed unless
                        otherwise specified by the canteen management.

                        The canteen reserves the right to substitute items in the event that certain products are out of
                        stock. Users will be notified of any changes before order fulfillment.

                        The personal information collected through the System will only be used for the purpose of
                        facilitating the ordering process. This includes processing orders, sending notifications, and
                        communicating with Users.
                        Personal information will not be shared with any third party outside of the school without the
                        User’s consent, except where required by law or school policies.
                        The school administration reserves the right to access User information for purposes related to

                    <v-card-text>
                        The System is provided on an “as-is” and “as-available” basis. The school does not guarantee
                        that the System will be uninterrupted or free from errors.
                        The school will not be liable for any losses or damages arising from the use of the System,
                        including but not limited to missed pickups, unavailable items, or order inaccuracies, except in
                        cases of gross negligence or intentional misconduct.
                        Users assume full responsibility for their use of the System and agree that the school and
                        canteen will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.
